        <h1 style="color: blue;border: 5px solid yellow;"> First Week at AkiraChix</h1>
        <img src="images/codehive" style="height:500px;width: 700px;">
        <p>On the 1st of February 2025 I stepped at my dream school called <b>AkiraChix.</b>We received a warm welcoming plus a compus tour from the alimni.
        Later we were given breakfast and sat in a place called <i>Kaya</i> and the founder <b>Linda Kamau</b> gave a nice speech about what the school expects from us and the parents.
        After that our parents were allowed to depart to go back home.This is the time i realized that i am officially in school for a whole year without going home but I hade to choose my studies so that I can become a better person in future.
        We were allowed to rest becouse most of us had a long journey.
        Basically the whole week was all about orientation and getting to know each other both the students and AkiraChix community.</p>
