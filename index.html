        <img src="images/codehive" style="height:500px;width: 700px;">
        <span>On the 1st of FebruarY 2025 I stepped at my dream school called <b>AkiraChix.</b>We received a warm welcoming plus a compus tour from the alimni.</span>
        <span>Later we were given breakfast and sat in a place called <i>Kaya</i> and the founder Linda Kamau gave a nice speech about what the school expects from us and the parents.</span>
        <span>After that our parents were allowed to depart to go back home.This is the time i realized that i am officially in school for a whole year without going home but I hade to choose my studies so that I can become a better person in future.</span>
        <span>We were allowed to rest becouse most of us had a long journey.</span>
        <span>Basically the whole week was all about orientation and getting to know each other both the students and AkiraChix community.</span>
        <h2 style="color: blue;border: 5px solid yellow;">My Experience</h2>
